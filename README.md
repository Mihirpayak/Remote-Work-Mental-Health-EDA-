This project investigates the relationship between remote work and mental health through comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
The analysis seeks to uncover patterns and insights into how remote work environments impact mental well-being, productivity, and overall life satisfaction.
Using various data visualization techniques, we explore trends related to work-life balance, stress levels, and the challenges of remote work on mental health.
